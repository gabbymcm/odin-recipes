        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagna is delicious. It has many layers of yumminess as seen in the photo above. 
            The following recipe is for a no-bake skillet lasagna that you make on the stovetop and is a nice easy alternative to store-bought hamburger mixes.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground beef</li>
            <li>Spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>Diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Basil</li>
            <li>Oregano</li>
            <li>Malfada noodles</li>
            <li>Mozzarella</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
                Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. 
                Drain and discard grease. Add spaghetti sauce, tomatoes, onion, garlic, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook over low heat until sauce is hot, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook mafalda noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir until completely coated. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
            <li>Place skillet under the hot broil and cook until cheese is golden and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
